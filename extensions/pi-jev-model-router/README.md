# pi-jev-model-router

A pi extension that routes every prompt to a model tier using **Jev**
(System One) typed judgments through TypeSafe or OpenRouter. You type normally; before the turn starts, Jev
reads the request and answers four narrow questions, code composes those into a
tier, applies your budget policy, and pi switches to the matching model.

```
you type a prompt
        │
        ▼
   Jev (one request, 4 parallel questions)
     • task_kind            choice: plan / implement / debug / refactor / review / research / explain / operate / write / chat
     • complexity           score:  trivial → architectural
     • capability_deserved  score:  minimal → maximum (price ignored)
     • needs_deep_reasoning noul:   yes/no probability
        │
        ▼
   code composes the decision
     demand = 0.55·complexity + 0.45·capability (+ reasoning nudge)
     demand = max(demand, kind floor)          # planning/review never go cheap
     confidence guard → budget guard → availability guard → cache guard
        │
        ▼
   pi.setModel(node) + pi.setThinkingLevel(node)  → the turn runs on that model
```

The split is deliberate: **Jev judges the task, code owns the budget.** Changing
your spend caps never invalidates the judgment, and the judgment stays a pure
semantic read of the request.

## What you see

**In the transcript.** Every decision is written as a durable entry, so you can
always see which model the request went to and why:

```
jev-router → high  openai/gpt-5.3-codex
implement · complexity 1.70/3 · capability 1.55/3 · reasoning 0.82 → high
· budget 12% of cap → one tier down
```

Expand the entry (same key as other collapsible content) to see the raw judgment:
kind and its confidence, complexity, capability deserved, deep-reasoning
probability, composed demand score, and budget pressure.

The glyph encodes the action: `→` switched, `=` already active (stickiness),
`•` notify-only mode, `×` skipped (kept current / unavailable). Entries are stored
in the session but never sent to the LLM, so they cost no context.

**Not-routed prompts are shown too**, so routing is never silently absent:

```
jev-router · not routed
acknowledgement — staying on the current model
using openrouter/~anthropic/claude-opus-latest
```

A prompt is left on the current model for a clear reason: it is an
acknowledgement (`yes`, `continue`, …), a short continuation inside an ongoing
conversation, or no configured route is available. A short *first* message in a
fresh session (like `hi`) is a real request and **does** get routed. Duplicate
skip entries for the same reason and model are collapsed.

**In the status bar.** `jev-router:` followed by the active tier and session
spend, e.g. `jev-router:high · $0.42 · 12%`, `jev-router:on` before the first
route, or `jev-router:off` when disabled.

## Install / location

This extension lives at `~/.pi/agent/extensions/pi-jev-model-router/` (global, auto-discovered).
pi hot-reloads it with `/reload` after edits.

TypeSafe is the default Jev provider:

```sh
export TYPESAFE_API_KEY=...
```

To use Jev through OpenRouter instead:

```sh
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...
export JEV_ROUTER_PROVIDER=openrouter
```

You can also set `"jevProvider": "openrouter"` in the config file. The extension
accepts `apiKey` there and can reuse credentials saved by `/login openrouter`.

## Data sent to Jev

Each classification sends the current request text, configured Jev model
identifier, fixed routing questions and task taxonomy, plus the credential in
the HTTP authorization header. Conversation history is not sent by default.
Setting `historyTurns` above `0` explicitly opts in recent user and assistant
text, capped at 600 characters per message and 4,000 characters in total.
Images and tool results are not included.

The working directory, active routed model, context token count, session ID,
ledger, spend totals, and budget caps stay local. Routing code uses them only
after Jev returns its semantic judgment. Review a custom `endpoint` before
opting into history and consult the endpoint provider's data-retention policy.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `/jev-router` | Status: mode, spend, routes, kind specialists, last decision |
| `/jev-router on` / `off` | Enable/disable routing |
| `/jev-router mode auto\|confirm\|notify` | `auto` switches silently; `confirm` asks each turn; `notify` only tells you |
| `/jev-router budget daily 10` | Session-only daily cap (persist it in the config file) |
| `/jev-router budget monthly 150` | Session-only monthly cap |
| `/jev-router why` | Re-run Jev on the last prompt and show the full judgment + decision trace |
| `/jev-router revert` | Switch back to the model that was active before the last auto-switch |
| `/jev-route <text>` | Classify arbitrary text and show the recommendation without switching |

The LLM can also call the `jev_route` tool to ask for a tier recommendation for
a subtask.

## Configuration

Optional. Create `~/.pi/agent/pi-jev-model-router.json`
(see `pi-jev-model-router.example.json`), or `<project>/.pi/pi-jev-model-router.json` for
project-specific routes. Later sources win: defaults → global → project → env
(`JEV_ROUTER_PROVIDER`, `JEV_ROUTER_MODE`, `JEV_ROUTER_OFF=1`). Selecting
`openrouter` uses `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`,
`https://openrouter.ai/api/alpha/decisions`, and `~typesafe/jev-latest`; selecting
`typesafe` uses the existing TypeSafe defaults. You can still override
`apiKeyEnv`, `endpoint`, and `jevModel`.

```

### Two axes of routing

1. **Tier** (`quick` → `standard` → `high` → `premium`) is the *budget axis*. Each
   tier is an ordered **candidate chain**; the first model that is available and
   authenticated wins, so you get automatic fallback when a model is down or
   your key can't afford it.
2. **`kindModels`** is the *task axis*. A kind-specialist chain is tried before
   the generic tier chain, filtered by `minTier`. Eligible specialists are ranked
   by how close their `minTier` is to the chosen tier, so a cheap specialist never
   wins a premium-quality turn. This is how planning can land on a strong reasoner
   while implementation lands on a coding specialist.

Rules of thumb baked into the defaults:

- planning / review → strong long-horizon models, floored at `high`
- implement / debug / refactor → Codex-style coding specialists, floored at `standard`
- explain / chat / write → cheap fast models
- research → long-context readers

### Budget behaviour

`spend pressure = max(today ÷ dailyUsd, month ÷ monthlyUsd)`.

- `pressure ≥ softRatio` → drop one tier
- `pressure ≥ hardRatio` → force `quick`, unless the demand score is ≥ 2.5
  (clearly architectural), which is allowed to stay at `standard`

Spend is accumulated from each assistant message's computed cost into
`~/.pi/agent/pi-jev-model-router-state.json`, alongside Jev request counts. Daily
and monthly totals are shared across concurrent pi sessions, with per-session
attribution under `bySession`. Ledger updates are inter-process locked and written
with atomic file replacement. A temporary persistence failure queues the delta
in memory, updates the local budget view, warns once, and retries on the next
update and at session shutdown. The queue is not crash-durable.

### Prompt-cache awareness

Caches are per-model, so any switch makes the next request re-read the whole
prefix at full input price — cache reads are only ~10% of input, so one switch
costs roughly the entire context once, on every provider. The router gates
switches instead of making them freely:

- `maxPenaltyUsd` — estimated miss (`contextTokens × new input rate − cached
  rate`) above this blocks the switch
- `deadband` — demand must clear the current tier's band (`tier ± 0.5`) by this
  much before a tier change happens, so boundary-hovering prompts stop flapping
- `bypassTierDelta` — a jump this large still switches (genuine capability change)
- same-tier specialist swaps are priced identically, since they are still model
  changes

Set `cache.aware: false` to switch unconditionally. The estimate is skipped when
pricing is unknown, so it never blocks on guesses.

### Confidence

If Jev's `task_kind` confidence is below `confidenceThreshold` and the suggested
tier is above `standard`, routing falls back to `standard` rather than spending
premium money on a guess. Low confidence on a harmless preference is not treated
as an error.

## Tuning notes

- `useDefaultModels: false` drops the built-in `routes`/`kindModels` entirely, so
  only the models in your config are used. Tiers or kinds you don't configure
  become empty and are skipped, never back-filled from the defaults.
- A model switch resets the provider prompt cache. `cache.aware` (default on)
  gates switches by their estimated cache penalty, so tune `cache.maxPenaltyUsd`
  down for more switching, or up for more stickiness. `cache.aware: false`
  restores unconditional switching.
- `stickiness: true` is the cheap version of the same idea: it avoids re-applying
  a decision when the chosen model is already active.
- Model IDs are provider-scoped; the defaults assume `openrouter`. Swap them for
  whatever providers you have configured. `/jev-router status` marks each route
  `✓`/`✗` based on what is actually available and authenticated.
- `minPromptChars` (default 12) governs when a short message counts as a
  continuation and is left alone; a short first message in a fresh session is
  still routed. `/` commands, `yes`/`continue` acknowledgements, and `!` bash
  lines are never routed.

## Files

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `index.ts` | pi wiring: events, commands, `jev_route` tool, model switching |
| `config.ts` | config types, defaults, layered loading |
| `jev.ts` | TypeSafe/OpenRouter Decisions client, question definitions, response parsing |
| `router.ts` | composition (`decide`), tier/kind chains, availability fallback |
| `budget.ts` | spend ledger, caps, pressure |

## Failure behaviour

Routing never blocks your turn. A missing TypeSafe/OpenRouter key, network error,
timeout (default 3.5 s, retried on 429/529), or unknown model means: warn in the status line and
run the prompt on the current model unchanged.

## Compatibility

Optional `ExtensionAPI` surfaces are feature-detected, so the extension loads on
older pi builds and downstream forks. If `registerEntryRenderer` or
`@earendil-works/pi-tui` is unavailable, the transcript card is skipped and
decisions still appear via the status bar and notifications. Missing
`appendEntry`, `ctx.ui.select`, or `modelRegistry.find` degrade to no persistence,
auto-switching, or "leave the model unchanged" respectively. `@earendil-works/pi-tui`
is an optional peer dependency.
